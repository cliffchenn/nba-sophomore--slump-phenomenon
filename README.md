A data driven look into the phenomenon known as the sophomore slump in the NBA. 

## What is a Sophomore Slump
The sophomore slump is a phenomenon observed in professional sports where a player's level performance declines or remains static in their sophomore (second) year when compared to their rookie (first) year. The term 'slump' is used because there is an expected level of improvement going from a player's rookie (first) to sophomore year. A player is usually described to be in a sohphomore slump after they have some degree of success in their rookie year. The term is thrown around loosely by sports fans and analysts, so this project attempts to use data from the NBA to quantify the sophomore slump. 

## How to Quantify a Sophomore Slump
To quantify a sophomore slump, a player's rookie and sophomore stats will be compared to find the statistical improvement between year 1 and 2. Firstly, a control group must be established with players who can be objectively seen as those who did not experience a sophomore slump (with my knowledge as a fan). Players are then compared against this threshold to determine if there is a statistically significant difference in rate of improvement. The statistics are categorized into 3 measures: usage, efficiency, and defense. Usage measures the amount of playing time the player receives. Efficiency measures how many points are scored with the shots they take. Defense measures the ability to stop the opponent from scoring.
